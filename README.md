# kopriva-spectral-python

These are (awful) python implementations of a selection of spectral methods from [Kopriva][]'s [Implementing Spectral Methods for Partial Differential Equations][impl-spectral].

I originally wrote these implementations in 2010 while trying to wrap my head around spectral methods and learn how to write numerical code in Python.
Ultimately I tried to convey some of the things I'd learned at the end of the class in this [poster][].
Writing this stuff up at the end of 2016, though, I'm not sure I ever managed to wrap my head around spectral methods and I'm terribly embarrassed at the python code I wrote.

I recall taking some effort to transcribe the methods as "literally" as possible, given my abilities and numpy limitations, but surely I made lots of mistakes and left lots of experimental code laying around.
My apologies for that.
